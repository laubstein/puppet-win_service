# win_service #

This a first attempt at creating a puppet type and provider to manage the configuration of windows services. This currently is utilizing Ruby for pulling properties from a node and using the windows SCM to create services.
Future updates will move to fully using either ruby gems or the Windows SCM.

README Updates to Follow.
